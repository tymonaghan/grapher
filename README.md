# grapher
Processing tool for visualizing arrays

Grapher is designed as a utility for the SOTU-db project. Ultimately grapher will intake data into an array and create visualizations for that data. Designed using Processing.

*note: grapher is incomplete and not currently maintained, but I may come back to it in the future!
